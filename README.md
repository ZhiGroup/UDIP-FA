## Main structure of this repo
1. FA_GWAS_all.ipynb
This Jupyter notebook focuses on the analysis of UDIP-FA, including:
	•	Association analyses within UDIP-FA features
	•	Associations with polygenic risk scores (PRS) for brain disorders
	•	Explainability assessment of UDIP-FA features
	•	Comparison with findings from previous studies

2. FA_all.R
An R script for post-GWAS analyses, including result processing and generation of publication-ready figures.

3. FA_network_drug_analysis.R
An R script for the final stage of the analysis, performing network-based analyses related to drug targeting and mechanism exploration.
